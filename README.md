# DivineC

DivineC is my own Esoteric Programming Language inspired by Terry A. Davis's HolyC-lang. DivineC is a form of extension to HolyC lang such as C++ to C, yet with "more holyness" and references to the Bible and Testaments.

# DISCLAIMER

**IMPORTANT: This project is intended as lighthearted programming satire and educational content only.**

As a believer and a respectful programmer myself, I want to be absolutely clear that:

- **This is NOT meant to mock or disrespect any religion, faith, or spiritual beliefs**,
- **This project is purely satirical/parody in nature** - inspired by the programming language community's tradition of creating esoteric and humorous languages,
- **All religious references are used with respect and humor**, not to trivialize or diminish the importance of faith,
- **This is a programming exercise and creative project**, not a statement about religion or spirituality,
- **I deeply respect all faiths and belief systems** - this project comes from a place of appreciation for the creativity and passion of the programming community.



**✨ May your code be blessed and bug-free! ✨**
